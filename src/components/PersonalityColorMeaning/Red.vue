    <h5>RED personality traits</h5>
    <p class="text-justify">
      They are strong leaders, fast paced thinkers, risk takers, purposeful,
      drivers, strong-willed, less patient, obvious energy, formal overtly competitive,
      rational.
      You may recognise many of the qualities of the REDS are in many leaders
      as they take ownership, need to be fast paced in their thinking,
      take risks and be purposeful and confident with it.
    </p>

    <h5>Things RED's don't like</h5>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Don't waffle - remember, they are less patient and whatever you do,
      don't be vague or ramble on.
      They value time, so again don't waste their time,
      don't get too personal as REDS just like to stick to business,
      don't stray from purpose, these personality types are focused in their thinking, and
      don't ask irrelevant questions, they get impatient and it does not fit
      in with their rational thinking patterns.
      Lastly don't try to take control, REDS are
      natural leaders and like to feel they are in control.
    </p>

    <h5>How to interact with a RED Personality</h5>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Do get to business quickly, when interacting with a RED be succinct and precise
      give them facts, and avoid the detail, talk to them about results
      and outcomes, they need to hear this to make quick decisions.
      Use their time efficiently, they are fast paced thinkers and tend to move quickly in
      their thoughts, great people to bounce ideas off, be confident when you talk to a red.
