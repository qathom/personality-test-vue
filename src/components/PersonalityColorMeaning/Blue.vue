    <h5>BLUE personality traits</h5>
    <p class="text-justify">
      BLUES are deep thinkers, analytical in nature,
      very detail focused and formal in their thinking.
      They can come across as being aloof, but are
      deliberate in their approach and systematic,
      precise and pays attention to detail. They like things in their place,
      and are very organised with good time management skills.
      They are sticklers for time and are capable
      of coming to their own conclusions without having examples of others pushed at them.
      They take their time in their thinking and are much slower paced than the reds or yellows.
      BLUES can come across as perfectionists due to their logical, systematic,
      precise and deliberate approach to problems or solutions.
      BLUES like to have all the facts, and then logically put
      together an answer that is suitable.

    <h5>Things BLUEâ€™s don't like:</h5>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Don't come across as disorganised with a BLUE as they are very tidy.
      Try not to be late as they are sticklers for time keeping.
      Try not to be flippant or pushy with them. They don't like vagueness so make sure you have
      lots of detail and be prepared to have lots of questions thrown at you. Don't
      use testimonials or exaggerate claims as they do not fall for this,
      they are more facts and figures orientated.
      Don't be too emotional as they cannot handle emotions.

    <h5>How to interact with a BLUE personality</h5>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Be well prepared when dealing with a BLUE personality, get into detail as they love to
      get all the facts in their mind. Be factual, specific and logical
      with your approach. Listening is important to a BLUE so listen carefully
      to what they have to say, as they verbalise their thoughts through questioning thoroughly.
      Give them time to respond as they are slower paced thinkers.
      Be formal in your approach as they are very businesslike.
