      YELLOWS don't like it when you suppress their opinions or get into intricate details.
      They are social animals and don't like it when you are too
      impersonal, business-like or task orientated, you need to weave this into the conversation.
      Don't try and inhibit their creativity, or appear aloof or
      detached.

    <p class="text-justify">
      Key to interacting with a YELLOW is to socialise before mentioning any business.
      To get into their good books talk about options and other people.
      Be enthusiastic and energetic when conveying your ideas over to
      them and be fast paced in delivering them.
      Offer your ideas and importantly use humour when doing so being
      sociable and acknowledge their input.
