    <h5>GREEN personality traits</h5>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Cool laid back relaxed and patient best describes the personality traits of the GREEN.
      They are easy to get along with and very informal in their approach.
      They are social and focus on relationships so can come across as emotional.
      They are much slower paced in their thinking and are very democratic people.
      They are very understanding, and agreeable.
      They say yes, but mean no? The green is the go between for
      the reds and yellows who are much faster paced.
      They act as the facilitator to conflicts.

    <h5>Things GREENâ€™s don't like</h5>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Don't be pushy or put them on a spot, GREENS absolutely hate this.
      Don't try and dominate the discussion or rush things and they do not like
      when you decide for them so try to avoid this.
      Don't be abrupt, explain in full and do not make wild claims or demands.
      They can also tell if you are insincere, so try not to be.
    </p>

    <h5>How to interact with a GREEN personality</h5>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Be friendly and show genuine interest in them, chat before going into business.
      It is important to develop trust first, be informal and nonthreatening.
      However, be alert for non-verbal signs of concern, remember they say yes but mean no,
      but their body language will alay this. If you notice any non-verbal signs of concern,
      uncover their needs with open questions. Allow them to weigh things up for themselves.
